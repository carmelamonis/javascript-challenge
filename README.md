## Summary

Given specific data, most of the time the best way to visualize the data is by displaying it on a table. Most of the data provided include UFO sightings, and only JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js could be used. The dataset provided is in the form of an array of JavaScript objects. The goal is to use JavaScript and DOM manipulation in order to display the UFO information in a table.

## Scope

Given an HTML web page, I used JavaScript and D3.js to append a table to the web page with the following information of each UFO sighting:
 - Date/Time
 - City
 - State
 - Country
 - Shape
 - Comment

Given a date input, the web page will display the UFO sighting information for that given date.
